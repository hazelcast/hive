/*
 * Note:
 * What's the motivation for statically settings the height of this particular element?
 * We need to prevent the height of this element to expand the size of the calendar popper itself.
 * There are basically 2 ways to do this:
 * 1. Settings the height of the popper container
 * 2. Settings the height of the element itself
 *
 * Even though I think option 1 is readable a bit better, there is this odd feature, where react-datepicker
 * renders 6 weeks (rows) instead of 5 for some of the months. This expands the height by 1 week row,
 * and would cause overflow in case of option 1.
 * Therefore only option 2 is left.
